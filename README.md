# Cadassist
This AutoCAD Automation Application is a sophisticated tool designed to streamline the process of making real-time changes to AutoCAD projects using natural language commands. This application leverages the power of generative AI, specifically Code-Llama, to generate Python automation scripts based on user inputs. The scripts are executed directly within the AutoCAD environment, allowing users to see their changes reflected in real-time.
